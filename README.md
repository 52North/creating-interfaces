# Creating Interfaces - Deployment

This repository contains the setup for deploying Citizen Science data collection tools developed within the <a target="_blank" href="https://creatinginterfaces.eifer.kit.edu/">Creating Interfaces</a> project on a public server.

The setup uses Apache HTTP Server, Caddy, PostgreSQL and Docker/Docker Compose. 

There are two different tools included in the deplyoment:
* Slupsk Tool: https://github.com/52North/slupsk-tool
* Tulcea Tool: https://github.com/52North/tulcea-tool

### Deployment steps

* Clone this repository including the submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/52North/creating-interfaces.git`
* Go to project root: `cd creating-interfaces`
* If the checked commit in the submodule does not contain recent changes: `git submodule update --remote`
* Create an `.env` file with the following content
  ```
  SLUPSK_DB_PW=<your-pw>                                                                                                                                         
  SLUPSK_SECRET_KEY=<your-key>
  TULCEA_DB_PW=<your-pw>
  TULCEA_SECRET_KEY=<your-key>
  ```
* Change the server name in `TulceaTool.conf`, `SlupskTool.conf` and `caddy/Caddyfile` to your domain
* Build the docker images: `docker compose build`
* Start the docker containers: `docker compose up -d`
* Once the containers are running, you can create a super user account:
  * Find out the container id of the slupsk-tool or tulcea-tool: `docker ps`
  * Execute an interactive bash shell on the container: `docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash`
  * Activate virtual environment: `. venv/bin/activate`
  * Create super user account: `db/manage.py createsuperuser` 

If you only want to deploy one tool, you can comment the respective services and volumes in the `docker-compose.yml`.
